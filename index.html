		<h1 class="heading-intro">Introduction</h1>
		<p>I’m an adventure seeking and music loving individual. I currently work as a software developer but outside of work I am always looking to travel and discover new things.
		<p>My greatest passions are mountain biking and music/video production. I hope to soon find a way to mix all those together through a travel/video blog. And hopefully also be able to freelance and make some money on the side to fuel my passions.</p>

<!--SECTION 5 BLOG-->
	<section class="blog">
		<h1>Blog Post</h1>
		<p>This is my blog. It's really bloggy. How can I take up space?? I'll tell you a story. That's what blogs are all about! Here's my story: I'm on a mission to become the best damn web developer in Austin. Why? Well, definitely not because I think it's easy. But I know I can do it and with enough practice it'll become second nature. Just like anything else.</p>
		<p>There have been numerous times just in the past month that I've run into other web developers at coffee shops and bars. It's a big thing here in Austin apparently. And they're interested in hiring! What great news is that? I'll be eager to begin learning more with a company soon. Adding these newfound skillz</p>
