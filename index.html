	<h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
	<p>I’m an adventure seeking and music loving individual. I currently work as a software developer but outside of work I am always looking to travel and discover new things.
<p>My greatest passions are mountain biking and music/video production. I hope to soon find a way to mix all those together through a travel/video blog. And hopefully also be able to freelance and make some money on the side to fuel my passions.</p>
